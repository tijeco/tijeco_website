# About me

I am currently a PhD student in biology at East Carolina University. I am fascinated by spiders and their venoms, and I am currently researching how venom has evolved in spiders in the Michael Brewer Lab.

I am originally from a small town in rural northwest Georgia called Cedartown. I spent the entire first 18 years of my life in that town, and graduated in a class of about 200 students. Growing up in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains allowed me to develop a deep passion for the natural world, which led to my pursuance of a biology degree at Samford University in Birmingham Alabama.

I am also passionate about percussion music and software development. I typically find myself tapping snare drum rudiments along to songs playing in the background. After over a decade of marching in a drumline it is hard not find those hidden patterns. My github page is fairly active with projects I hope to make decent progress on in the upcoming year. I am starting to gain interest in machine learning, as well as generative art, so hopefully some fun side projects will be coming soon!
