      <description>About me I am currently a PhD student in biology at East Carolina University. I am fascinated by spiders and their venoms, and I am currently researching how venom has evolved in spiders in the Michael Brewer Lab.

I am originally from a small town in rural northwest Georgia called Cedartown. I spent the entire first 18 years of my life in that town, and graduated in a class of about 200 students.</description>
