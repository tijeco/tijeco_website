Fire suppression has greatly impacted the forest ecosystems of the southeastern United States. Fire-suppressed remnant longleaf pine forests in Oak Mountain State Park (OMSP; Pelham, AL) have undergone experimental prescribed burning as a means to restore the understory and overstory structure of a healthy montane longleaf pine forest. We studied the populations of a species of ground hunting spider Ctenus hibernalis as an indicator of understory arthropod response to prescribed burning. Study sites included regions burned one year prior to the study, five years prior, as well as a region that has experienced long-term fire suppression. No individuals of **C. hibernalis** were found in the region burned one year prior. Overall, there was no significant difference in the total number of spiders in the fire-suppressed region and the region burned five years ago, but there was a significant difference in the weights of the two populations. Our results suggest that the prescribed burning is beneficial to C. hibernalis populations and positively affects their overall fitness levels.
